    <p>Malka had been been plucking for years, and had unfortunately undergone many unsuccessful laser treatments. She had reached the point where she was plucking every day for 10 minutes before she could go out. There was a lot of strong hair growth on the chin and cheeks to clear.</p> 
    <p>After 20 one hour treatments of multi needle electrolysis over the course of a year, Malka is now hair free. She no longer feels self conscious in social settings and is very glad she finally found Simcha, and the permanent solution.</p>

    <p>Chana was always bothered by her sideburns, and hated looking at pictures of herself. She was apprehensive at first because her previous experience with electrolysis was very painful and she bled. After a consultation that relieved Chana of her fears, she took the plunge at Simchaâ€™s clinic, undergoing 15 treatments of 45 minutes using the blend technique.</p> 
    <p>The sideburns are now a thing of the past. Chana is now coming for 15 minute treatments once every 6 months to finish clearing up the few finer hairs that are left. Chana loves the way she looks!</p>

    Shira came to my clinic with a hair growth problem that no else she had previously consulted with, had wanted to treat. Shira had dark, medium to fine hair growth all over her cheeks, chin and neck. This cast a shadow all over her face and it bothered her immensely, For the first 6 months Shira was coming weekly for hourly sessions. With time the treatments tapered off. 
    <br>Now, 30 treatments later, Shira is almost hairfree and at the end of her electrolysis journey. Not only with a beautiful hairfree complexion but with lots of self confidence as well!
